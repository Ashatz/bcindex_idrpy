Boyce Continuous Index (for idrtools/idrpy)
=============

This repository contains a script to run the spatial Boyce Continuous Index (BCI) using the idrpy (idrtools) package.  The BCI model provides a measure of consistency between species distribution models (SDM) and ommitted validation locations resampled during a typical SDM workflow.  This script not only calculates the model BCI, but also provides tabular and spatial representations of the predicted/expected ratio for all SDM partitions and a mean/median calculation for all combined partitions.
